# Matias Yocca 👨🏻‍💻

Just your average Joe that plays video games and likes to code. Looking to build performant and efficient projects, learn and understand new technologies, and craft awesome software.

I am a backend software engineer with experience in PHP and Laravel, but sometimes I like to dabble in frontend stuff or even some DevOps.

I use Nix btw.

## Technologies 🛠

My go-to tech stack is [Laravel](https://laravel.com/) with [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). I also have experience in [Go](https://golang.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and I'm always looking to learn new technologies.

I also have experience in blockchain development, mainly in EVM-based blockchains and [Solidity](https://soliditylang.org/) together with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/), and currently learning [Foundry](https://getfoundry.sh/) in my own free time.

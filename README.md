Just your average Joe that plays video games and likes to code. Looking to build performant and efficient projects, learn and understand new technologies, and craft awesome software.

I am a backend software engineer with experience in PHP and Laravel, but sometimes I like to dabble in frontend stuff or even some DevOps.

I use Nix btw.
